bash-prompt-customizer-cli
==========================

Bash prompt customizer is a command line program that allows users to customize their bash prompts by letting them select elements and colors. It also displays the elements that user has selected. It finally stores the created value of PS1 to ~/.bashrc file, if the user opts to save the generated configuration. On it's first run, it stores the initial value of PS1 to ~/.bashrc with which PS1 can be restored to the initial value, before this program was run.
