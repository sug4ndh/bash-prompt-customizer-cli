bash-prompt-customizer-cli
==========================

Bash prompt customizer is a bash program that allows the users to customize their bash prompts by letting them select elements and colors. It also gives a preview of the elements that user has selected. It finally stores the created value of PS1 to ~/.bashrc file, if the user opts to save the generated configuration. On it's first run, it stores the default value of PS1 to ~/.bashrc with which PS1 can be restored to its initial value before running this program.
